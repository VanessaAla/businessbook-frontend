# BusinessBook App

# üë©‚Äçüíª What is this app about:
As en expat living in the Netherlands I am always looking for businesses to cover my needs. I came up with this app to make the process of the search easier.

- Redux for state management
- Authentication

   * REST API
- Sequelize as ORM

- React-Bootstrap üî•

üî•  New technology learnt during this project

# ‚≠ê Goals for this project
The goal of this project is to build fullstack app, by practicing already known as well as learning new technologies.

- Practice building a full-stack app
- Build a working app in 9 days
- Apply what we learned over the past 8 weeks at the Codaisseur full stack bootcamp
- Extend knowledge of a new technology independently
- Showcase and document development skills using:
     * Wireframes
     * Data model
     * Writing user stories
     * Kanban project approach
     * Transparent and structured Git version control

# üìì User stories
- As a user I want to search a business by category and city.
- As a user I want to sign up and login.
- As a user I want to make an appointment with one or more businesses.
- As a user I want to update my personal details.
- As a user I want to register my business.
- As an Admin user I want to see all the signed up users as well as the businesses.
- As an Admin user I want to block or unblock users and delete businesses.

ü§ì I am planning to implement the following user stories:
* As a user I want to see the status (requested, pending, declined) of my appointment.
* As a user that owns a business I want to accept or decline appoitments requested.
* As a user I want to read and send notifications to the business I am interested to.

This project is a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome, please let me know! You can contact me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangelia-alamani-487647137/).
