# Welcome to the Businessbook Application

This is an App made as part of my final Project as a Student in Codaisseur Coding BootCamp. This is a project made in 9 days from scratch using no templates or previous code.

# üë©‚Äçüíª The idea behind this app:

As en expat living in the Netherlands I am always looking for businesses to cover my needs. I came up with this app to make the process of the search easier. This app is a place where a user can sign up search for a business, book an appointment with the business as well as register their own business (if they own one).

# ‚≠ê Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build fullstack app, by practicing already known as well as learning new technologies.

- Practice building a full-stack app
- Build a working app in 9 days
- Apply what we learned over the past 8 weeks at the Codaisseur full stack bootcamp
- Extend knowledge of a new technology independently
- Showcase and document development skills using:
  - Wireframes
  - Data model
  - Writing user stories
  - Kanban project approach
  - Transparent and structured Git version control

# üìì User stories

- As a user I want to search a business by category and city.
- As a user I want to sign up and login.
- As a user I want to make an appointment with one or more businesses.
- As a user I want to update my personal details.
- As a user I want to register my business.
- As an Admin user I want to see all the signed up users as well as the businesses.
- As an Admin user I want to block or unblock users and delete businesses.

ü§ì I am planning to implement the following user stories:

- As a user I want to see the status (requested, pending, declined) of my appointment.
- As a user that owns a business I want to accept or decline appoitments requested.
- As a user I want to contact the business for further information.

This project is a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome, please let me know! You can contact me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangelia-alamani-487647137/).
